// Cancel confirmation (#120 / #116). An HTTP 200 from /order/cancel_order is
// not a broker cancellation: the returned Trade is usually still Submitted
// with cancel_quantity 0 (1.7.6 simulation, verified). Shioaji 1.7.6 projects
// active reports into the sidecar Trade cache before SSE delivery, so the
// confirmation reads that cache (`refresh:false`, no broker call) for a short
// window, then does exactly one authoritative `refresh:true` read.
//
// Rules (fail closed):
// - Confirmed only by a row with the same order.id and account, status
//   Cancelled, and cumulative cancel_quantity covering the quantity that was
//   remaining when the cancel started (original order.quantity minus filled).
//   status.order_quantity is never used: 1.7.6 HTTP rows report it as 0.
// - An order missing from the cache is NOT a cancellation, and no Cancelled
//   Trade is ever synthesized from local data.
// - Anything else throws CANCEL_UNCONFIRMED (mutationOutcomeUnknown). The
//   caller must reconcile; nothing here resends the cancel.
//
// Shioaji#234 (still open upstream): simulation reduce-then-cancel can leave
// HTTP rows Submitted after an SSE Cancel. Simulation results here are
// regression evidence only, not production proof.
