# Native Content and Backtests

Read this reference when the user asks to create or inspect a Shioaji Pro
custom indicator, mount or change a chart indicator, create a strategy, or
inspect a backtest result. These operations use semantic App Tools; they do not
grant trading authority. For source code, supported `ta.*` functions, signal
semantics, execution timing, and validation examples, also read
[CONTENT_AUTHORING.md](CONTENT_AUTHORING.md).

## Indicators and Strategies

- An unqualified request to create an indicator or strategy in a connected
  Shioaji Pro session means native App content, not Pine Script or a workspace
  file. A source snippet is not a saved App item.
- Use `list_custom_indicators` before editing an existing indicator and
  `save_custom_indicator` to create or update it. Overwriting an existing
  shared definition requires the App's content confirmation because it affects
  every chart using that definition. A concurrent definition change invalidates
  the proposed overwrite; read again and prepare a new proposal.
- Use `list_strategies` before editing an existing strategy and `save_strategy`
  to create or update it. When converting an indicator into a strategy,
  preserve its parameters and signal meaning, then make entry and exit
  conditions explicit.
- Supply a new opaque caller-generated `idempotency_key` for each mutation
  intent. Preserve it with its exact arguments for a transport retry. A changed
  payload, including corrected source or parameters, requires a new key.
- A validation failure is actionable feedback. Correct the source with the
  runtime defined in [CONTENT_AUTHORING.md](CONTENT_AUTHORING.md), then submit
  the corrected intent with a new key. Completion requires a successful receipt
  and a fresh list read showing the saved content.

## Chart Indicator Workflow

1. Locate the intended K-line panel with `list_panels`, then read
   `list_indicator_instances`. Prefer explicit `panel_id`. Omitting it targets
   the most recently focused, mounted K-line chart; with no valid target, use
   the error's available panels to resolve the target. Backtest charts and
   detached popouts are outside this panel control surface.
2. For a new custom indicator, call `save_custom_indicator`, then pass its
   returned `indicator_type` (`custom:<id>`) to `mount_indicator`. A saved
   definition is separate from a mounted instance. Built-in type IDs must come
   from the App's advertised state or existing instances; do not guess them.
3. Use `update_indicator_instance` to merge parameter changes, set `hidden`,
   or move the instance to a zero-based `index`. Carry `panel_id`, `instance_id`
   and the latest `expected_revision` from the read receipt. The revision is an
   opaque string, not a counter. A conflict requires a fresh read and a new
   mutation intent; preserve intervening UI or Agent changes.
4. Use `remove_indicator_instance` for removal. The App resolves and binds the
   target panel and revision before asking for content confirmation. This
   removes the chart instance; the shared custom definition remains available.
5. Make a fresh `list_indicator_instances` call for the receipt's `panel_id`.
   Verify the returned instance ID, type, parameters, visibility and order, or
   its absence after removal. Paginate until the relevant instance is covered;
   an idempotent mutation receipt alone is not a current-state read.

All four tools require `ui.control`. Mutations require `idempotency_key`;
content confirmations grant no trading authority. A host timeout means the
outcome is unknown: read current instances before considering another mutation.
An older or disconnected App may advertise a tool while its indicator host is
unavailable; report the limitation instead of claiming the chart changed.

### Indicator Tool Arguments and Receipts

Inspect the live schema first. All tools accept optional `panel_id` (string).

| Tool | Other arguments | Receipt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mount_indicator` | Required `indicator_type` and `idempotency_key`; optional `params` | `panel_id`, `revision`, `instance` |
| `list_indicator_instances` | Optional `offset` (default 0), `limit` (default 20, maximum 100) | `panel_id`, `revision`, `instances`, `page` |
| `update_indicator_instance` | Required `instance_id` and `idempotency_key`; optional `params`, `hidden`, `index`, `expected_revision`; supply at least one change | `panel_id`, `revision`, `instance` |
| `remove_indicator_instance` | Required `instance_id` and `idempotency_key`; optional `expected_revision` | `panel_id`, `revision`, `removed_id` |

`params` is an object of finite numbers keyed by declared parameter names;
values must satisfy that indicator's range and step. `hidden` is boolean.
`offset` and `index` are non-negative integers; `limit` is a positive integer.
An index must fall within the current instance list. Each panel supports at most
100 instances. Instances expose `id`, `type`, `params`, styles, and optional
`hidden`; an absent `hidden` means visible. The page includes `offset`, `limit`,
`returned`, `total`, and `hasMore`. Continue from `offset + returned` while
`hasMore` is true, checking that the revision stays unchanged across pages.

Panel settings persist with the workspace and layout profile. A layout change
or removal can invalidate panel IDs and revisions; refresh the App state.
Successful mounting or matching stored parameters verifies configuration, not
indicator arithmetic or backtest correctness. Numerical claims require fixed
input data and independently checked expected values.

## Backtest Result Reading

Backtest snapshots can be large. Read progressively:

1. Call `get_backtest_result` first. Report its state as `empty`, `running`,
   `failed`, or `completed`; do not infer completion from partial metrics.
2. For `completed`, summarize strategy, symbols, interval, date range,
   parameters, cost assumptions, aggregate metrics, and material risks.
3. Call `list_backtest_symbol_results` only when per-symbol comparison is
   needed. Page with `offset` and `limit`; the default is 20 and the maximum is
   100. This tool omits trade arrays.
4. Call `get_backtest_trades` only for a named symbol or a question that needs
   individual trades. Page from newest toward older trades; the default is 20,
   the maximum is 100, and only the latest 500 trades per symbol are retained.
   A multi-symbol Batch Run requires `symbol`.

Phase 0 snapshots are in-memory, ephemeral, and not reproducible run records.
State that limitation when it affects the answer. A `multi` result is a Batch
Run of independent single-symbol tests, not a Portfolio Run; do not infer
cross-symbol capital allocation, portfolio exposure, or portfolio-level risk.

## Persistent Portfolio Research

The Phase 2 tools use an immutable revision and a persistent run ID. Read
`list_strategy_revisions` or `get_strategy_revision` before changing a shared
strategy. `create_strategy_revision` creates a child of the current head;
updating an existing artifact requires content confirmation. The source and
parameters are pinned, and an older run remains unchanged after a new revision.

Call `start_backtest_run` with `revision_id`, `code`, interval `minutes`,
`days`, optional parameter values, quantity in lots/contracts, capital,
discount, futures fee, and slippage ticks. It reads K-bars and simulates fills;
it has no broker order path. Use `get_backtest_run` for progress or
`cancel_backtest_run` to stop. A cancelled run is terminal; late worker output
cannot replace it. `list_backtest_runs` can recover IDs after the panel closes.

After completion, read `get_backtest_summary` for the manifest and versioned
metrics. Its bounded `rejections` summary gives counts, reasons, and an
estimated capital need when all entries are blocked. If any rejections occur,
explain them in the reply and suggest adjusting initial capital when funding
blocks entries; do not report only "zero trades". Keep the 1× leverage default.
For the #35 execution question, the manifest records interval, date
range, pinned data snapshot ID, fees, tax, tick, lot, multiplier, sizing, and versions;
`get_backtest_run_trades` shows entry and exit times/prices. The manifest's
`signalExecution` records all-bar evaluation, close confirmation, next
available open fills, and no engine daily-entry cap. Inspect the pinned source
with `get_strategy_revision` to determine authored OR/AND conditions and
filters; metrics alone cannot prove those rules. Page trades in
chunks of at most 50 and request `get_backtest_equity` with at most 500 points.
`compare_backtest_runs` accepts 2–10 run IDs and returns compact metrics.
`open_backtest_run` opens a deep link; select a trade row to zoom the chart to
its entry/exit interval.
`get_backtest_portfolio` reads portfolio metrics, per-asset and tag attribution,
and paged fills, rejections, and diagnostics. Request at most 20 rows per page.

These tools require `ui.control`, not `trade.preview` or `trade.execute`.
Starting, reading, cancelling, comparing, and opening research requires no
trading approval. Tool schemas define exact arguments and idempotency keys.

Use `start_portfolio_backtest` with `universe_kind: static`, one to eight
explicit codes, and `calendar: union | intersection`. One code follows the
same portfolio engine. Missing data is a partial failure: name the unavailable
asset and gap from the manifest; do not count it as a zero-return trade.
Dynamic selectors are unavailable until survivorship-bias rules exist.

For optimization, pass a complete parameter value space, Grid or Random
search (Random needs a seed and count), nonoverlapping train/test dates,
resource limits, minimum trades, and a cost ratio limit to
`start_optimization_job`. Poll `get_optimization_job`; use
`cancel_optimization_job` if requested. Read `list_optimization_candidates`
by pages of at most 20, then `get_optimization_candidate` for selected
train/test metrics and child run IDs. Ranking uses train results. Report train
and held-out test separately, describe their gap and sensitivity, and warn
about overfitting before recommending another experiment. Use child run IDs
with `get_backtest_summary`, bounded trade/equity readers, and
`open_backtest_run` for inspection. `export_backtest_run` produces CSV trades,
JSON manifest, PNG equity, or Markdown research report; the App owns the save
destination. No research tool sends an order.
